# NGINX REMOTE RECONFIGURATION
This tool is designed to act as a comprehensive interface to the nginx-router deployed in the onesait-platform. It's main goal is to simplify the interaction with the nginx instance that bridges internal network services with the outer world.
## Installation
To install the nginx-reconf tool you can build your own docker image, first take a look at the `.env` file and customize it according to your needs, then try typing the following commands. Please, keep in mind that onesait control panel service must be up and running, otherwise nginx will refuse to start.
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
The docker image will expose 2 ports, 90TCP as the main nginx port, and 8000TCP as the configuration port. This behavior can be changed by editing the `nginx.conf` file available at the conf folder.
If you want to modify the behavior of the API, you can take a look inside the file `src/reconf/reconf/settings.py` and customize the following values:
```
CONFIG_PATH="/etc/nginx"
RECONF_COMMAND="nginx -s reload"
TEST_COMMAND="nginx -tc {filename}
```
## Usage
The interface provides the following functionality through a simple REST interface.
### Get current nginx configuration
Obtains the current configuration and returns it in plaintext.
```
Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/nginx
Verb: GET
Return Body: plaintext with the current nginx.conf file.
Return Code: 200 or 500.
```
###  Test nginx configuration
Tests if the provided nginx configuration will run properly in the instance, the interface will place the configuration in the `/etc/nginx` folder and will run `nginx -tc {filename}`
If something goes wrong the interface will return the nginx error as-is in the body and the return code will be set to 500.
```
Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/nginx/test
Verb: POST
Body: {NGINX_FILE}
Return Code: 200 or 500.
    500 means that the file will produce an error starting nginx.
Return Body: The error returned by nginx.
```
###  Set nginx Configuration
Sets the provided configuration file as the main nginx configuration in the system, and takes a backup of the current configuration. This command will not test if the config file is correct, use with care. The server will perform a nginx reload executing the command  `nginx -s reload`. In the case that a wrong configuration is set, it may happen that nginx won't start, don't panic, the REST interface still allows you to undo the action.
```
Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/nginx/set
Verb: POST
Body: {NGINX_FILE}
Return Code: 200 or 500.
    500 well done, you broke nginx, now it's down.
Return Body: The Error returned by nginx.
```
###  Get All the Available Versions
Gets all the available versions stored as a backup in the nginx config folder and returns a json list with the version and the number.
```
Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/nginx/versions
Verb: GET
Return Code: 200 or 500.
Return Body: JSON list of versions.
[{"version": 1, "date": "2019-10-02"}, {"version": 2, "date": "2019-10-02"}]
```
### Get a Version
Gets a version listed as available in the versions list, and returns it as plaintext.
```
Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/nginx/version/{VERSION}
Verb: GET
Return Body: plaintext with the specified nginx.conf file version.
Return Code: 200, 404 or 500.
	404 Means that the requested version can not be found in the system.
```
### Return to the Last Used Version
Restores the last used nginx config version and reloads it with the command `nginx -s reload`.
```
Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/nginx/undo
Verb: PUT
Return Code: 200, 405 or 500.
	405 Means that there are no versions to restore. Mainly, you are in the first configuration.
```
### Return to a Numbered Version
Restores a version from the version list and reloads it with the command `nginx -s reload`.
```
Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/nginx/undo/{VERSION}
Verb: PUT
Return Code: 200, 404, 405 or 500.
	404 Means that the requested version can not be found in the system.
	405 Means that there are no versions to restore.
```
### Reset nginx to the Initial Values
If nothing works you can always return to the initial `nginx.conf` file. You are welcome. ðŸ˜Š
```
Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/nginx/reset
Verb: PUT
Return Code: 200 or 500.
```
## Goodies
This tool is integrated in the onesite-platform with a  GUI that will simplify the procedure of interacting with the API.
## Troubleshooting
Please keep in mind that if you are using Windows Services for Linux, to build and run the docker image, you must be sure that your git client will not change the native Linux LF character by the Windows CR character, otherwise you will get a glorious and almost untraceable error in docker.
