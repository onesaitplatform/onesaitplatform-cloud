	"detailedDescription":"onesait Platform Android HealthCheckApp\n============================\n\n## Features overview\nThis app is a full working example showcasing several tools available in the platform to deal with:\n\n1. User authentication: OAuth-based user authentication for any operation\n2. Data privacy enhacements: Patient data is protected with private APIs that belong to the patient. As data owner, the patient is able to grant and revoke access to his data at any time via API calls within the app (Auth as-a-Service) or via onesait Platform control panel.\n3. APIfication: All interaction with onesait Platform is performed via APIs registered in the API Manager module.\n\n## App overview\n\nThe app features two different behaviors depending on the end-user profile. For this case, 2 users have been created:\n\n1. citizenHealth: This role performs as a health-aware citizen that keeps track of some of his health-related paremeters (weight, blood pressure, etc..) Using the app, the citizen is able to log this data to onesait Platform. Then data is stored and available to him for self-analytics and/or medical evaluation (upon the citizen approval of data sharing).\n2. specialistHealth: This role performs as a medical specialist that offers her expertise. onesait Platform allows this specialist to give service to any registered patient within the onesait ecosystem, anytime, anywhere. On the app screen she will be able to check her mailbox (an ontology with public access via a public API so any citizen can send requests). The mailbox contains anonymous health data from the incoming patient requests (previous patients approval to share their data with the selected specialist). Then the specialist is able to send feedback to the patient using the app an onesait Platform.\n"
