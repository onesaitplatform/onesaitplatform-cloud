tooltip_ontologies=Ontologies are the data models within the platform. They are represented via a JSON-Schema (JSON for the instances) and transparently to the programmer can be stored in different types of storage.
tooltip_clients= Digital Client represents each of the clients of the platform, typically they are devices & systems sending information to the platform, but they can be devices subscribed to other information, mobile or web applications visualizing information stored on the platform or complete systems. A Device handles 1 or more ontologies.
tooltip_rules=A Rule represents the execution of a more or less complex logic, the Rules can be executed before the arrival of an Instance or with a temporal planning (CRON). The Rules can be of type IF-THEN (Script Rules) or of type CEP (temporary relationship between several instances). The Rules can be created in different languages (R, Python, Groovy) through the Console itself....
tooltip_visualization=The Visualization Tools allow me to exploit in a simple and graphic way the information stored in the Platform (Ontologies). I can create unit display elements (Gadgets), join them in a web page (Dashboard).
tooltip_tools=Support tools for development, operation, ...
tooltip_administration=Platform administration tools: user management, platform monitoring, operations management, security.
tooltip_apiManager=The API Manager allows you to publish APIs on all the information managed by the Platform, all in a visual way.
tooltip_socialMedia = The Social Media analysis tools provide access to information of different social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) and APIs (Google Analytics, Brandwatch). This module supports streaming and scheduled loads, and also exporting the data to Ontologies.
tooltip_analytics=The Platform has multiple analytics capabilities, like the DataFlow engine (allows you to configure sources, destinations and transformations to manipulate data) and the Notebooks (they allow data scientists to apply data transforms and Machine Learning algorithms).
tooltip_apis= APIs allow you to make operations with ontologies, such as CRUD operations and custom queries.
tooltip_webprojects=Web projects are independent static web projects, that are hosted by the platform.
tooltip_digitaltwin=Digital twins are faithful representations of real physical systems and devices.
tooltip_flows=Flows are data flows for data processing, made with Node Red.
tooltip_notebooks=Data notebooks.
tooltip_dataflows=Dataflow.
